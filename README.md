Project Overview
The Netflix Movie Data Analysis project aims to explore and analyze various attributes of movies available on Netflix. The project utilizes data analysis and visualization libraries in Python, including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy, to provide insights into movie genres, popularity, and trends over the years.

Objectives
•	Identify the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix.
•	Determine which movie has the highest average votes.
•	Find the movie with the highest popularity and identify its genre.
•	Find the movie with the lowest popularity and identify its genre.
•	Determine which year had the most films released

Methodology
Data Collection
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes of Netflix movies, such as title, genre, release year, vote average, and popularity score.
Data Processing
Using the pandas library, the dataset was cleaned and processed. Key columns were selected for analysis, and data types were appropriately converted (e.g., converting the release year to an integer).
Data Analysis and Visualization
Multiple analyses were performed to answer the project objectives. The following Python libraries were utilized:
•	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•	Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
•	Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and enhancing the visual appeal of the graphs.
•	NumPy: For numerical computations.
 
Key Milestones
•	Data cleaning and preprocessing completed.
•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed to derive insights.
•	Visualizations created to represent the findings graphically.

Results and Findings

•	 Visual Representation: A line graph showing the trend of movie releases over the years.
 
Conclusion
The Netflix Movie Data Analysis project successfully provided insights into various aspects of movies available on the platform. Through extensive data analysis and visualization, we uncovered trends in genres, movie popularity, and release years. The findings can help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding content acquisition and marketing strategies.
Future Work
•	Extend the analysis by incorporating user ratings and reviews to gain deeper insights into movie performance.
•	Include advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, to predict future movie popularity based on historical data.
•	Analyze the impact of external factors (e.g., seasons, events) on movie releases and popularity.
